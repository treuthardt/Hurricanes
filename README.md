# Overview 
This is a repository for our group's downloaded hurricane images, from 1995 through 2015 in the Atlantic basin. Images are sorted first by year, then by hurricane name. Image details (size, group analysis) may be provided later.

All images are sourced from NOAA's GOES satellite Imager, through [CLASS](https://www.class.ncdc.noaa.gov/saa/products/welcome), and were originally edited into JPEG format using NOAA's [Weather and Climate Toolkit](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/wct/).
